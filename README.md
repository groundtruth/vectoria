# Vectoria

*Flexible, beautiful and authoritative map layers for government and business*

When critical decisions require up-to-date and authoritative maps, commercial and crowdsourced datasets such as Google, HERE and OpenStreetMap often can't provide the certainty that government authorities and businesses need.

The Vectoria project combines data import processes, dataset schemas, styling rules, and map tile deployment processes to enable you to prepare and serve vector map tiles of open data from authoritative sources for use in your web maps.
